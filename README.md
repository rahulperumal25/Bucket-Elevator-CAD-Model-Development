Developed a CAD model of a Bucket Elevator for bulk material handling in industrial settings using AutoCAD and SolidWorks. 
The design features a vertical tower with a series of buckets that transport material from the base to the discharge point, ensuring efficient and reliable operations.
The robust metallic structure enhances durability, while the 3D visualization provides clarity on dimensions and spatial arrangement, aiding in seamless integration into industrial plants.
